# COCO Semantic Segmentation Analysis

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the COCO dataset for semantic segmentation, a task in computer vision where the aim is to classify each pixel in an image as belonging to a specific class. This analysis is focused on understanding the distribution of various objects in the dataset and exploring segmentation results using different methods. The insights gathered from this project could help improve segmentation models and contribute to advancements in computer vision research.

## Project Description
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the COCO dataset for semantic segmentation, which includes images labeled with pixel-wise annotations for a variety of object classes. The dataset is widely used in machine learning and computer vision for tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and captioning.

Key areas of focus include:
1. Analyzing the distribution of object categories within the dataset.
2. Understanding the structure of the segmentation masks.
3. Implementing and evaluating baseline semantic segmentation models.
4. Visualizing segmentation outputs and comparing model performance.
5. Exploring challenges in pixel-level annotation and segmentation accuracy.

The model is built using TensorFlow, and Google Colab GPU was used in the training process. The model has been trained for a few epochs so far, but learning can be continued to obtain more accurate results.
