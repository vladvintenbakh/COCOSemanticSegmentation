# COCO_Semantic_Segmentation

The notebook contains a full pipeline for training a semantic segmentation model using the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home). The model is built on TensorFlow, and Google Colab GPU was used in the training process. The model has been trained for few epochs so far, but learning can be continued to obtain more accurate results.
